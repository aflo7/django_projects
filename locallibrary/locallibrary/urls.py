"""locallibrary URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.views.generic import RedirectView
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
]

# whenever a catalag/ url is queried, let catalog.urls.py process the remaining substring.
urlpatterns += [
    path('catalog/', include('catalog.urls'))
]

# Now let's redirect the root URL of our site (i.e. 127.0.0.1:8000) to the URL 127.0.0.1:8000/catalog/. This is the only app we'll be using in this project. To do this, we'll use a special view function, RedirectView, which takes the new relative URL to redirect to (/catalog/) as its first argument when the URL pattern specified in the path() function is matched (the root URL, in this case).
# this is the homepage
urlpatterns += [
    path("", RedirectView.as_view(url="catalog/", permanent=True)),  #'' implies '/'
]

# Django does not serve static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images by default, but it can be useful for the development web server to do so while you're creating your site. As a final addition to this URL mapper, you can enable the serving of static files during development by appending the following lines.
urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
